1. we allow same name of class and struct. c++ doesnt bcoz it has functions in struct. but since we don't it wont affect our name mangling.

2. pointer as function arg is working fine ig(atleast int*).

3. don't do this : class person *ptr, p; (if u have to declare, use separate lines like class person *ptr; class person p;)
